# Solution

- I reckoned from the form example image above, that each section could have been separated into individual form wizard page, but I decided not to do it, as it was a little too much to implement in this exercise.
- Removed duplicated Spanish option from both choice questions, no other languages were duplicated, so I figured this was a mistake.
- In the real world form example, question about other languages should not be required, so no languages selected should be a valid option, but I've let it be how it was defined.
- Age input should probably have min, max and step metadata options defined, pattern that matches only integers wouldn't hurt either.
